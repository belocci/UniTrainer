# Cloud GPU (CanopyWave)

Uni Trainer runs locally by default. You can optionally use CanopyWave cloud GPUs for heavier training jobs.

## Local Execution
- Uses your local CPU/GPU.
- No internet connection required after installation.

## Optional Cloud Execution
- Requires a CanopyWave account and API key.
- Jobs are submitted to the cloud and results are returned to your machine.
- Local data is only uploaded when you choose cloud mode.
