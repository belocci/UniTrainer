# How to Build Your App with the Custom Icon

## Quick Steps:

1. **Open PowerShell or Command Prompt** (Windows)

2. **Navigate to your project folder:**
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\vaugh\transfer package - uni trainer"
   ```

3. **Run the build command:**
   ```powershell
   npm run build:win
   ```

4. **Find your built app:**
   - After building, go to: `dist\Uni Trainer-win32-x64\`
   - The executable will be: `Uni Trainer.exe`
   - Your app now has the custom icon!

## What Happens:

- The build process packages your app into a standalone executable
- It includes your custom icon (`build/icon.ico`)
- The finished app will be in the `dist` folder
- You can share the entire `Uni Trainer-win32-x64` folder with friends!

## Tips:

- The first build might take a few minutes
- Make sure Node.js is installed (you already have it)
- If you see any errors, let me know!
